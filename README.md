-This is a project about simulating a basic CPU with pipeline
It implements an instruction-level simulator for a single cycle MIPS processor in C++. The simulator supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set and can model the execution of each instruction.

Instrutions are stored in Imem.txt;
Data are stored in Dmem.txt;
